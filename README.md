# Malpractice Mentioned Website — Kode With Klossy Capstone Project

This repository is part of my computer science and data-science learning portfolio.

It contains the code and resources for **Malpractice Mentioned**, a capstone website developed during the Kode with Klossy Data Science camp. For this group project, I led the front-end design and worked on connecting back-end data sources and interactive visualizations.

## Project Overview  
Mal.Mentioned is a responsive web experience designed to surface insights from structured data using embedded visualizations. Key features include:
- A clean and modern interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Integration of MySQL data-pulls to load and prepare structured data for display.  
- Embedded interactive Tableau graphs that deliver visual storytelling aligned with the dataset.  
- Collaboration with a team to define data queries, design visuals, and implement the UI for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used  
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Data layer: MySQL (structured queries, data normalization)  
- Visualization: Tableau charts, embedded into web pages  
- Version control: Git & GitHub to manage code, track contributions, and collaborate  

## Key Features  
- Mobile-friendly and responsive layout for optimal viewing on multiple devices  
- Embedded interactive dashboards (via Tableau) that allow users to explore trends and patterns  
- Separation of UI, data queries, and visualization assets for maintainable structure  
- Team-based workflow including branching, peer review, and code integration  

## Learning Outcomes  
Through this project I:  
- Connected front-end web development with relational database back-end logic using MySQL  
- Learned how to embed and control Tableau visualizations within a web environment  
- Strengthened collaboration, version control, and workflow skills in a multi-person project  
- Enhanced my ability to design web interfaces that present data clearly, attractively, and responsively

Feel free to review the code, explore the embedded dashboards, and trace how data flows from the database through visualization to the web interface. I will continue refining this project as my data-science and development skills grow.
